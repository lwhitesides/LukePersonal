CONCURRENT SESSIONS
-Goal:estimate the max number of concurrent sessions for any given time based off a sample of customer call data

-First approach: 
--For every second within the sample's time range, check if the session falls between the start time and end time of the session.
--Shortcomings:performance

-Current approach:
--For every session check if the end time falls between the start time and end time of other sessions
--This just checks how many sessions one overlaps with. Not how many were running concurrently. 

-After counting the number of sessions for a sample, multiply it by the current sales projections estimate the future concurrent sessions

Results from 12/18/21 - 12/20/21 SLSH sample
Devices:~160
Max Concurrent Sessions: 9 - ran script of counting concurrent sessions on sample of SLHS sessions from 12/18/21 to 12/20/21

Projections for EOY 2022
Devices:5500
Sessions: 9*5500/160 = ~300
